Description: Clears the workspace. Useful for the beginnings of R scripts, to avoid potential problems with accidentally using information from variables or functions from previous script evaluations, too many figure windows open at the same time, packages that you don't need any more, or a cluttered console.  Uses code from various StackOverflow users, particularly David Robinson, shadow, Gavin Simpson, Ramnath, Joshua Ulrich and E Luxo So.  See the code for pointers to the relevant StackOverflow pages.
